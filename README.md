Many sites like time.mk , daily.mk, blogirame.com 
use an IFRAME to display the sites they link while providing 
a panel on the top with their own functionalities.

Most of the people who don't use their sites, 
but do click links that go through their sites,
end up with their panels on top taking up screen space 
while providing no desired features.

This add-on tries to find out the embedded IFRAME's source 
and redirect the browser to that URL, 
thus removing the undesired panels.
